# AvalonXmlAgent.bundle

Avalon Xml Agent is a Plex TV and movie ageet that is inspired by [XBMCnfoTVImporter.bundle](https://github.com/gboudreau/XBMCnfoTVImporter.bundle) and [XBMCnfoMoviesImporter.bundle](https://github.com/gboudreau/XBMCnfoMoviesImporter.bundle).
It is designed to use XML file as metadata instead of pull data from internet.
It allows you to maintain and backup your metadata much easier and prevent some random guys on internet modifiy the metadata that you used to.

## Compare to XBMCnfoTVImporter and XBMCnfoTVImporter
Avalon Xml Agent is very strict about naming convention and nfo format. This allows much cleaner code. Also, Avalon Xml Agent has the mininal feature.

One of the feature is static nfo name. It can read `show - s01e01.nfo` even when a better version `show - s01e01.hd.mp4` has been add.
